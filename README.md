Urological problems affect both men and women, often impacting the kidneys, bladder, ureters, urethra, or male reproductive organs. Common urological issues include urinary tract infections (UTIs), kidney stones, bladder control problems (incontinence), enlarged prostate (BPH), and male infertility. Symptoms can vary but often include painful urination, frequent urge to urinate, blood in the urine, lower abdominal pain, or difficulty starting urination. These signs should never be ignored, as they can indicate underlying infections, obstructions, or even cancer. At Care and Cure Hospital in Ahmedabad, expert urologists use the latest diagnostic tools like ultrasound, cystoscopy, and urine tests to accurately assess the condition. Treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes, or surgical intervention depending on the severity. Early diagnosis can prevent complications and improve quality of life.
